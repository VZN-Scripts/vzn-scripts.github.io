### LOCALES

-   This script is using ox_lib locales. You can edit values in `locales/*.json`. If you add your language, you can send it us in our discord and we will add it to our script

### LOGS

To Configure logs go to `config_server.lua` and put here your discord webhook

-   if you want to edit logs logic go to `server/editable/functions.lua` on function called `SendLog`

```lua filename="config.lua"
-- your wehbhook where logs will be sent
---@type string
SConfig.LogWebhook = "your_webhook_here"
```

### FRAMEWORK NAMES

```lua filename="config.lua"
--- If you have custom name of exports / resourceName, change it here to script can works correctly.
--- If you wanna connect your custom framework look at bridge/custom/*.lua.
--- If you wanna edit your framework functions etc look at bridge/your_framework/*.lua
---@type table<string, {resourceName: string, export: string}>
Config.Framework = {
    ESX = {
        resourceName = "es_extended",
        export = "getSharedObject",
    },
    QB = {
        resourceName = "qb-core",
        export = "GetCoreObject",
    },
}
```

### JOB NAME

```lua filename="config.lua"
--- job name that player needs have to use job (remember to add job to db for ESX or to jobs.lua for QBCore)
---@type string
Config.JobName = "cleaner"
```

### SALARY METHOD

-   If player should earn money in cash, set this field to `cash` (ESX too, not money)
-   If player should earn money in bank account, set this field to `bank`

```lua filename="config.lua"
--- in which method player will be getting salary for job
---@type 'cash' | 'bank'
Config.SalaryMethod = "cash"
```

    pedCoords = vec3(1231.49, -1083.04, 38.51),
    pedHeading = 127.5,
