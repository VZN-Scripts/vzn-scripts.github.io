# FRAMEWORK

### AUTO-DETECTION

<Callout type="info" emoji="ℹ️">
    The framework is auto-detected based on started resource. You can look at it `bridge/**`
</Callout>

If you wanna edit framework functions go to `bridge/**/*.lua`

### CUSTOM CLIENT

If you wanna edit this functions you can do it. If you want to use custom frameworks, do similar logic in `bridge/custom/client.lua` using your framework functions

```lua filename="bridge/custom/client.lua"

--- getting framework object
FRAMEWORK = exports['your_framework']['export_name']()

--- load script if player is loaded when script started
Citizen.CreateThread(function()
    if FRAMEWORK.IsPlayerLoaded() then
        OnPlayerLoad()
    end
end)

--- load player on load
RegisterNetEvent("yourFramework:onPlayerLoad", function()
    OnPlayerLoad()
end)

--- refresh job blips on playerData job change
AddEventHandler('yourFramework::onJobChange', function()
    RefreshJobBlips()
end)

--- checking if player can work, you can edit it how you want (for example disable job based logic)
---@return boolean
function CanWork()
    return FRAMEWORK.GetPlayerJob() == Config.JobName
end

--- change clothes logic
local lastClothes = nil
function ChangeClothes(work)
    if not Config.Clothes.enabled then return end

    if work then
        local gender = FRAMEWORK.GetPlayerGender() -- male or female
        local clothes = work and Config.Clothes[gender] or lastClothes
        if not clothes then return end
        lastClothes = FRAMEWORK.GetPlayerSkin()
        TriggerEvent('yourFramework:changeClothes', clothes)
    else
        TriggerEvent('yourFramework:changeClothes', lastClothes)
        lastClothes = nil
    end
end
```

### CUSTOM SERVER

If you wanna edit this functions you can do it. If you want to use custom frameworks, do similar logic in `bridge/custom/server.lua` using your framework functions

```lua filename="bridge/custom/server.lua"

--- getting framework object
FRAMEWORK = exports['your_framework']['export_name']()

---@class PlayerJob
---@field name string unique name of the job
---@field label string

---@class Player
---@field source number id of player
---@field identifier string unique identifier of player to using it in db
---@field job PlayerJob
---@field addMoney fun(amount: number) adding money after job complete

--- returning Player object from id
---@param playerId number
---@return Player | nil
function GetPlayerFromId(playerId)
    local frameworkPlayer = FRAMEWORK.GetPlayer(playerId)
    if not frameworkPlayer then return end

    ---@type Player
    local player = {
        source = playerId,
        identifier = frameworkPlayer.getCharacterUniqueId(),
        job = {
            name = frameworkPlayer.job.name,
            label = frameworkPlayer.job.label,
        },
        addMoney = function(amount)
            local method = Config.SalaryMethod
            if method == "cash" then
                ---@diagnostic disable-next-line
                method = "money"
            end

            frameworkPlayer.addMoney(method, amount)
        end,
    }

    return player
end

--- checking if player can work, you can edit it how you want (for example disable job based logic)
---@param player Player
---@return boolean
function CanPlayerWork(player)
    return player.job.name == Config.JobName
end

MySQL.ready(function()
    if not FRAMEWORK.IsJobExisting(Config.JobName) then
        lib.print.error(string.format("`%s` job doesnt exists!! Add this job in your framework", Config.JobName))
    end
end)

```
