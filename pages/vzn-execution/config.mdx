-   if you want to edit logs logic go to `server/editable/editable_logs.lua` on function called `sendLog`

```lua filename="s_config.lua"

---@type string
SConfig.Webhook = 'your_webhook_here'
```

--- defining which system will be used to interact with locations
---@type 'ox_target' | 'prompt'
Config.Interaction = 'ox_target'
```

Config.NeedConfirmationToKill = true
```

    {
        chair = {
            coords = vec3(1997.16, -1471.64, 48.19),
            seatCoords = vec4(1997.16, -1471.64, 47.1330, 326.1991)
        },
        enableElectric = {
            coords = vec3(1999.3041, -1474.8317, 49.0260),
