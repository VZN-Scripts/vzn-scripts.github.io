# CUSTOM REWARD

Adding other rewards than items could be very wanted function. Of course our script is ready to do that

### CONFIG

<Steps>
### Add in config reward with other type than item, for example car
```lua copy
Config.Rewards = {
    -- ...
    [10] = { -- reward for 10 invites
        name = 'zentorno',
        count = 1,
        type = 'car',
        -- !!! VERY IMPORTANT THAT CUSTOM REWARD MUST HAS THESE FIELDS BELOW !!!
        label = 'Zentorno',
        image = 'https://github.com/MericcaN41/gta5carimages/blob/main/images/zentorno.png?raw=true'
    },
    -- ...
}
```

### Go to `bridge/your_framework/server.lua` to function called `AddReward` and implement your giving this type of reward logic

```lua copy filename="bridge/*/server.lua"
--- add reward for player
---@param player Player
---@param reward ConfigReward
function AddReward(player, reward)
    if reward.type == 'item' then
        local esxPlayer = ESX.GetPlayerFromId(player.source)
        esxPlayer.addInventoryItem(reward.name, reward.count)

    -- IMPLEMENT OUR TYPE FROM CONFIG ABOVE
    elseif reward.type == 'car' then

        -- for example our function to giving car
        GiveCarForPlayer(player.identifier, reward.name)

    else
        lib.print.warn('This type of reward is not implemented. Do it in vzn-references/bridge/esx/server.lua')
        --- implement it yourself
    end
end
```

</Steps>
